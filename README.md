# FL_IDS-GAN
Trying to study IDS-GAN in FL context

My master dissertation on NIDS based on GAN in Federated Learning context.
Update: Experimentation on Data Augmentation using Vanilla GAN on CIC-IDS-2017 for IDS-MLP & IDS-RFC and evaluation...maybe...FL theoric analysis only on thesis...


1. Preprocessing file on CIC-IDS-2017 (improved): https://intrusion-detection.distrinet-research.be/CNS2022/CICIDS2017.html
2. Dataset preprocessed in specific folder
3. Vanilla GAN for Data Augmentation
4. IDS-MLP multiclassification
5. IDS-RFC multiclassification
6. Evaluation on thesis pdf
